This Project is an extension of Walk These Ways - Paper 

Phase 1 - Train a locomotion policy for the Robotic dog to move forward , backward left and right at specfic speeds
Phase 2 - Build and Train a Navigation policy which governs the locomotion policy such that the robot can move from one end of confined space to the other
Phase 3 - Build and Train a Nvigation Policy which governs the locomotion policy such that the robot moves from one end to other end of the room by avoiding random obstacles initialized at random positions and sizes. 

Phase 2 - Navigation
